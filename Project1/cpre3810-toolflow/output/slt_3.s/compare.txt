Oh no...

Cycle: 3
RARS instruction number: 4	Instruction: addi x6,x6,-1
Expected:	No Overflow
Got     :	Overflow
Overflow is incorrect

Almost! your processor completed the program with  1/3 allowed mismatches

Helpful resources for Debugging:
ms.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
rars.trace : output from RARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
